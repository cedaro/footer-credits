A Customizer control to make footer credits editable.


== Description ==

**This plugin only works with themes that have added support.**

Footer Credits provides a standardized method for making theme credits editable. It registers a new section and fields in the Customizer for modifying the credits and choosing how they appear.

Theme authors, let your users and customers know your theme supports the Footer Credits plugin.

If your theme doesn't work with Footer Credits, ask the developer to add support. Instructions can be find in the [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/footer-credits/other_notes/) section.

== Installation ==

Install like most other plugins. [Check out the codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins) if you have any questions.

= Usage =

After installing:

1. Go to *Appearance &rarr; Customize* in your admin panel
2. Open the **Credits** section
3. Add some text to the **Credits** text area
4. Choose whether your custom text appears before, after, or replaces the default credits.

*Tip: Insert {{year}} in your text to have the year update automatically.*


== Screenshots ==

1. The Customizer section and fields.


== Notes ==

If you're a theme author and want to add support, all you need to do is pass the default credits string through a `footer_credits` filter.

= 1. Create a template tag with the default credits and filter: =

`<?php
if ( ! function_exists( 'themename_credits' ) ) :
/**
 * Theme credits text.
 */
function themename_credits() {
	$text = sprintf( __( '%s by Cedaro.', 'themename' ),
		'<a href="http://www.cedaro.com/wordpress/themes/hyalite/">Hyalite</a>'
	);

	echo apply_filters( 'footer_credits', $text );
}
endif;`

= 2. Then call the template tag somewhere in the footer of the theme: =

`<footer class="site-footer">
	<div class="credits">
		<?php themename_credits(); ?>
	</div>
</footer>`
